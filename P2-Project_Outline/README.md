## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is called Collector Director.  It is a web-app that will help collectors archive, organize, categorize, and prioritze the owned and unowned members of their specific collections.  Rather than dealing with the headache of creating a cumbersome, bland spreadsheet, or worse, using pen and paper, Collector Director makes keeping track of your passion easy and fun.  Instead of being a chore, it will be part of the joy of collecting!

Collector Director will allow users to easily organize their collections by category, owned status, price, rarity, priority, and condition.  They will be able to so effortlessly sort their collections using any of the previously mentioned properties, as well as search their collections for a specific item.  In order to add to the feeling of satisfaction of collecting, Collector Director will congratulate the user with a fun message when an item is changed from "unowned" to "owned" status.

### Features
Collector Director will give the user the ability to:
  -Log-in using their userID and password
  -Organize their collection or collections by assigning properties of each member of their collection, such as:
    -price
    -owned-status
    -rarity
    -priority
    -condition
    -notes
  -add categories and sub-categories to their collections
  -sort collections by properties and categories
  -gain satisfaction from adding to their collections by adding fanfare when an collection member is changed from "unowned" to "owned"     status
